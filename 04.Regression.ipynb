    "Lasso Regression, short for \"Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator\" Regression, is a regression technique \n",
    "that differs from other methods, such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression and Ridge Regression, due to its unique \n",
    "regularization approach. Lasso adds an L1 regularization term to the cost function, which penalizes the absolute sum of\n",
