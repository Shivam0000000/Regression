    "Elastic Net Regression is a linear regression technique that combines features of two other popular \n",
    "regression methods: Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression. It is used in machine learning and statistics \n",

    "Here's how Elastic Net differs from other regression techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression:\n",
    "->Ridge Regression adds a penalty term to the linear regression cost function that discourages the model \n",
    " from having large coefficients. This helps mitigate multicollinearity (high correlation between independent\n",
    " variables).\n",
    "->Ridge Regression uses L2 regularization, which adds the square of the magnitude of the coefficients to the \n",
    " cost function. This means that all variables remain in the model, but their coefficients are shrunk towards zero.\n",
    "->Ridge Regression can't perform variable selection, meaning it includes all features in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression:\n",
    "->Lasso Regression also adds a penalty term to the cost function but uses L1 regularization. It encourages sparsity\n",
    "  in the model by setting some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",
    "->Lasso is useful when you have a large number of features, and you want to identify the most important ones while \n",
    "  discarding the less important ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression:\n",
    "->Elastic Net combines the regularization terms of both Ridge and Lasso Regression. It uses a linear combination \n",
    " of L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization penalties.\n",
    "->Elastic Net is useful when you have a dataset with multicollinearity, a large number of features, and you want\n",
    " to perform both feature selection (like Lasso) and prevent large coefficients (like Ridge).\n",
    "->The Elastic Net hyperparameter \"alpha\" allows you to control the balance between L1 and L2 regularization. When\n",
    " alpha is 0, it's equivalent to Ridge Regression, and when alpha is 1, it's equivalent to Lasso Regression.\n",
